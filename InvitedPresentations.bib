@conference{Leu:14jan2,
	abstract = {Nanosphere coatings have the potential to not only enhance solar
efficiencies in silicon thin film solar cells without introducing
additional surface recombination, but also reduce manufacturing
processes and costs.  We demonstrate the ability to pattern silica
nanospheres of a wide range of diameters into close packed structures
of varying number of layers on silicon from a monolayer up to 20
layers using scalable spin coating methods.  These nanosphere coatings
enhanced the absorption and efficiency in the silicon across a wide
range of silicon thicknesses due to both antireflection and light
trapping.  We use simulations to determine the role of whispering
gallery modes in this light trapping.
Additionally, we study the angle dependency of the absorption enhancement.
These nanosphere coatings may also improve solar cell efficiencies by
providing self-cleaning function and improving heat dissipation.},
